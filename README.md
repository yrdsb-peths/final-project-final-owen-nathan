Planet of Men!
Our game was inspired by a recent meme that has risen on a debate that divided the internet - whether 100 men could take one silverback gorilla.
For our backstory, we made it a spin off of Planet of Apes, where instead of humans landing on a planet full of apes, it's a gorilla landing on a planet full of men.
Our gameplay was kept simple, with a gorilla fighting 2 tiers of humans and a final boss robot that may or may not symbolize the arising of AI that stands above the human race therefore being the strongest enemy in the game...
We made a shop system to help make the game engaging with heals for the gorilla health to make it more interactive, a fire trap that only damages tier 1 humans to make the game harder, and a cute little pet to accompany you.
Enjoy!
